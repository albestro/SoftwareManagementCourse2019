Goal: Write your first CMake

Topics:
- find_package
- add_executable/add_library
- target_link_libraries basic
- install a library

Part 1)
Write a CMakeLists.txt for the executable `dotprodcl` where the only dependency is on boost::program_options

Part 2)
Write a CMakeLists.txt which builds and installs the library `dotprod` (don't export targets at this point)

Maybe for the fast guys:
Part 3) Now link the library to dotprodcl.
We can then look how they do it and discuss problems based on their solutions.
