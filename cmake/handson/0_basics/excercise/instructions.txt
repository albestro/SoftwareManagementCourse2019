Part 1)

Write a CMakeLists.txt to compile the dotprodcl application.
- Its only dependency is boost's program_options.
- Use a cached variable to allow the user to select the floating point precision (float/double).
  Depending on the CMake variable, set the preprocessor macro "PRECISION" to 4 (float) or 8 (double).

Part 2)

Write a CMakeLists.txt to compile the dotprod library.
Add necessary commands to install the library and its headers.

Part 3)

Now use library in the dotprodcl application.
- Define the macro ENABLE_LIBRARY when compiling the executable. (Don't use this patterns in your project!)
- Write the necessary commands to find header and library.
