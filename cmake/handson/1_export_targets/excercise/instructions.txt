Part 1)

The dotprodcl application currently uses variables to point to its dependency, the dotprod library.
Additionally it explicitly sets include path and the library name. Write a FindDotprod.cmake to be
used in find_package(). Use "imported targets" to propagate needed information to the application
(include path, library). This is a strategy which you would apply if you don't want to modify the build
infrastructure of the library (see also Part 3)).

Part 2)

The dotprod library was extended and now contains testing code using googletest.
The googletest version, which is availabe as part of the repository (in external),
doesn't export its target. Update to the most recent version of googletest
(v1.8.1, https://github.com/google/googletest).
Use fetch_content() instead of making googletest part of your repository.

Part 3)

Write a dotprod-config.cmake which exports the target and installs it together with the library.
Update dotprodcl to use the exported target.
