Part 1)

The dotprod library was extended and now contains testing code using googletest.
The googletest version, which is availabe as part of the repository (in external),
doesn't export its targets.
Write a FindGoogleTest.cmake file to be able to discover googletest.
Use an interface library for this purpose.

Part 2)

Actually the most recent version of googletest (v1.8.1, https://github.com/google/googletest)
properly exports targets.
Update to this version by using fetch_content() instead of making googletest part of your repository.

Part 3)

Write a dotprod-config.cmake which exports the target and installs it together with the library.
Update dotprodcl to use the exported target.
