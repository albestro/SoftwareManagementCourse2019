Part 1)

The dotprod library was extended and now contains testing code using googletest.
The googletest version, which is currently part of the repository (in external),
doesn't export its targets.
Use to the most recent version (v1.8.1, https://github.com/google/googletest) by
using fetch_content() instead of making googletest part of your repository.
Compile googletest (TODO how do we do it? with add_subdirectory?)

Part 2)

Write a dotprod-config.cmake which exports the target and install it together with the library.
Update dotprodcl to use the exported target.
