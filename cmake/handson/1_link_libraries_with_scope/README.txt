Goal: Correct use of build and usage requirements

Topics:


TODO: We can make up a library which creates a conflict
in the executable if some dependency is not correctly flagged as build private.

Maybe: Example which uses an old gtest which doesn't export targets as starting point, rewrite to use fetch_content with a recent one, and use export targets.
