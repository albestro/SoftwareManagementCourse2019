Goal: Use ctest for executing your tests (TODO: define what else we do here)

Topics:
- ctest
- how to set the cxx standard (as discussed maybe we could use std::filesystem, e.g. to read some vectors from disc)
- See the effect of version number: make an api breaking change in the library
  and let the cmake of dotprodcl complain about on sufficient version number.
