Part 1)

The CMakeLists.txt is currently written in old-style CMake. Update the project to Modern CMake.

Part 2)

The dotprodcl application currently uses variables to point to its dependency, the dotprod library.
Additionally it explicitly sets include path and the library name. Write a FindDotprod.cmake to be
used in find_package(). Use "imported targets" to propagate needed information to the application
(include path, library). This is a strategy which you would apply if you don't want to modify the build
infrastructure of the library (see also Part 3)).
