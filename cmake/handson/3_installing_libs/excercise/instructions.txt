Part 1)

- Properly export the target for the dotprod library and install it together with the library (add a version
  number to the library)
- Update dotprodcl to use the exported target.
- Try that the version matching works by setting to an incompatible version in find_package().

Part 2)

The dotprod library was extended and now contains testing code using googletest.
The googletest version, which is availabe as part of the repository (in external),
doesn't export its target. Update to the most recent version of googletest
(v1.8.1, https://github.com/google/googletest).
Use fetch_content() instead of making googletest part of your repository.
