Goal: Use CUDA, MPI and Fortran

Topics:
- How to use CUDA as a language (and see how dependency to libcudart is transported via target)
- Fortran: something with generator expressions?
- MPI: play with workarounds, maybe introduce to the CMake issue tracker
 
TODO: this example needs major rewrite probably.
